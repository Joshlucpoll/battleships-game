# Battleships Game

Tkinter based battleships game where you fight an Ai to sink all the opposition's ships.

You have five ships to place on your 10x10 board:

- Carrier (5 long)
- Battleship (4 long)
- Cruiser (3 long)
- Destroyer (2 long)
- Submarine (2 long)

The Ai has the same - randomly placing their ships.
The Ai is faily crude at this stage but I'm hoping to improve it later on.
